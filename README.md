# ReactProfilePhotoUploader

The file to import just UploadProfilePhoto.jsx

The other files are just there to support it. The only prop that needs to be passed is an image Node that will be the user's 
current profile image. I have provided an example below of how it is imported. 

```
<ProfileUploader  image={userImage} >

```
